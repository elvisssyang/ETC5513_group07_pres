Are you interested in Happiness? The motivation for us to analyse the World Happiness Report is becasue of the deep idea that individuals are able to report their subjective experience in a way which can meaningfully guide individuals and societies towards better lifes. <br>

Our Data is gained in the <b>Kaggle</b> with 2015-2022 world happiness report data cotaining factors related to the happiness scores in each country at a worldwide level.

# Introduction 

<br>

__Our research are aim to solve the following questions__

+ The influences of COVID-19 on the world happiness score and correlations between happiness in 2021. 

--
+ The changes of happiness between 2015 and 2022 in different regions. 

--
+ What is the relationship between economic situation and health status with the happiness. 
--

+ In the modelling part, what are the important variables in explaining happiness scores and their performances in linear model. 

---
# Modelling

We will investigating the important variables in explaining the happiness scores via fitting various models including: 

+ Multivariate Model 

+ Support Vector Machine Model 

+ Decision Tree Model 

+ Random Forest Model

+ <b>Sample Split Ratio</b> = 0.4

# Modelling 

__ü•≥Overall we can see the performance of <b>Random Forest</b> is the best model to fit this data. Then we can get our variable importance.__

<b>Variable importance</b>

We can see the most important variables here are the economy (in GDP per capita) and Health. This is make sense because the economy and health are basic living demand for people. 

<b>Another Insight</b>

The Random Forest Model has few limitations. One major limitation is it cannot give us a better scope on the relationships between variables.

# Multivariate Linear model 


+ __To analyse the relationships between these variables, we constructed a <b>Multivariate Linear Model</b> in 2020. __


$$\begin{aligned}
log_{score}&= -2.7848-0.0006\ cpi+0.0776\ log_{economy}\\&-0.0058\ log_{population}+1.1040\ log_{health}
\end{aligned}$$


.font_my_2[

+ Based on the historical data, we found that the model is no longer efficient (with large $R^2$ value). Then we decide to add another two variables we think it's important to contribute the happiness score (Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Population of each country) and combined with the two important variables that we mentioned before. 

+ We then take the logarithm to analyse the percentage change in these variables. Then all the coefficients are the percentage change ratio can be written $\frac{\%\Delta Happiness}{\%\Delta Variables}$. 

+ In this year, people are extremely concerned about their health due to the global pandemic situation.

+ <b>Endogenous Bias</b>: Another latent variable in the error term still correlate with the variables inside the model. 



+ <b>Sample Selection Bias</b>: Our data source is not perfect. We only use the most recent data avaliable to us , which is year 2020 data. The situation during COVID and past COVID may different. In terms of NA values, we simply dropped out, which may influence our model prediction.
