<h2>Abstract and Data source</h2>

Do you know what drives happiness? The motivation for us to analyse the World Happiness Report is the deep idea that individuals are able to report their subjective experiences in a way which can meaningfully guide individuals and societies towards better lifes. <br>
<br>
<b style="font-size:24pt">Data Source</b><br>
Our data is the 2015-2022 world happiness report obtained from the <b>Kaggle</b> website. It contains factors that are related to the happiness scores in each country at a world wide level.

# Introduction 

<br>

__Our research aim to solve the following questions__

+ The influences of COVID-19 on the world happiness score and the correlations between happiness in 2021. 

--
+ The changes of happiness between 2015 and 2022 in different regions. 

--
+ The impact of economic situation and the health status on happiness.
--

+ The importance of variables in explaining happiness scores and an analysis of a multivariate linear model. 

---
# Modelling

We will investigate the important variables in explaining the happiness scores via fitting various models including: 

+ Multivariate Linear Model 

+ Support Vector Machine Model 

+ Decision Tree Model 

+ Random Forest Model

# Modelling 

__ü•≥Overall we can see the <b>Random Forest</b> model performs the best of fitting this data. Then we can sort our variables by their importance.__

<b>Variable importance order</b>

The right table indicates that the most important variables here are the economy (in GDP per capita) and Health. This makes sense because the better economy generally means the higher living standards and social wellbeings. Good health statues ensures higher productivity and the ability to enjoy the life, which will make people feel happy. 

<b>Another Insight</b>

The Random Forest Model has a few limitations. One major limitation is that it cannot provides a better scope on the relationships between variables.

# Multivariate Linear model 


+ __To analyse the relationships between these variables, we constructed a <b>Multivariate Linear Model</b> in 2020. __


$$\begin{aligned}
log(score)&= -2.7848-0.0006\ cpi+0.0776\ log(economy)\\&-0.0058\ log_(population)+1.1040\ log_(health)
\end{aligned}$$


.font_my_2[

+ Based on the historical data, we found that the model is no longer efficient (with large $R^2$ value). Then we decide to add another two variables we think it's important to contribute the happiness score (Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Population of each country) and combined with the two important variables that we mentioned before. 

+ We then take the logarithm to analyse the percentage change in these variables. Then all the coefficients are the percentage change ratio can be written $\frac{\%\Delta Happiness}{\%\Delta Variables}$. 

+ In this year, people are extremely concerned about their health due to the global pandemic situation.

__üëÄ Insights on Our Multivariate Linear Model Model __ 


.grid[



.font_my[




- <b>Limitations of our analysis</b>: 

.font_my_2[

- <b>Endogenous Bias</b>: Another latent variable in the error term still correlate with the variables inside the model, which influence our model's accuracy. 



- <b>Sample Selection Bias</b>: Our data source is not perfect. We only use the most recent data available , which is year 2020 data. The world was still experiencing the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 in 2020 at that time. In terms of NA values, we simply excluded them, which may lead to truncation bias.The exclusion of the subset can influence the statistical significance of the tests, can be biased. 


- <b>Significant Outliers</b>: From the analysis before we can get that there are few significant outliers may also influence the modelling accuracy too. „ÄÅ
